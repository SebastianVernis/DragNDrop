## 🚨 Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk
1. **Test Deadline (48h)**
   - Risk: Missing deadline impacts release
   - Mitigation: @qa can assist if needed

### Medium Risk
2. **DevOps Overload**
   - Risk: @devops at 100% capacity
   - Mitigation: Prioritize only critical tasks

3. **QA Underutilized**
   - Risk: Wasted resource capacity
   - Mitigation: Assign testing support tasks
